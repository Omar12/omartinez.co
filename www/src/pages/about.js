    <p>
      I’m a Frontend Software Developer from Seattle. For the 16 years of my
      professional career, I’ve been known as a “jack of all trades and a master
      of none”. I will write about anything that is worth reading. I love
      technology, music and video games. My dream job is to be a DJ.{" "}
