# Hello Once Again

Hello, let me try this again. I lost count, but this is my 10th attempt at having a blog.
My intention this time is to materialize my thoughts and share them. I don't have high expectations 
in regards how many people will read my writing, and to the least it will be a knowledge for myself.

The second part, is inspired by [Jason Lengstorf](https://www.jason.af/) personal site, where he uses it as a playground.
I don't have the opportunity to use ReactJS and modern JS in my day-to-day work, I will try things out and have fun with it.
